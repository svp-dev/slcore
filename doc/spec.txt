Terms and definitions
=====================

The following terms are defined in section 3 of the C standard and are
reused in this specification with their meaning as defined in C:

  argument
  - constraint
  - implementation
  - implementation limit
  - object
  - parameter
  - undefined behavior
  - unspecified behavior
  - value

The following terms are syntactic / semantic constructs defined in
section 6 of the C standard and are reused in this specification with
their meaning as defined in C:

  *block item*
  - *compound statement*
  - *constant expression*
  - conversion
  - *declaration specifier*
  - *declaration*
  - *definition*
  - *expression*
  - *identifier*
  - linkage
  - name space
  - processing environment
  - scope
  - side effect
  - *statement*
  - *storage class specifier*
  - storage duration
  - translation environment
  - type
  - type compatibility
  - *type specifier*
  - universal characters
  - visibility

The semantics of C with regards to objects, storage duration
(lifetime), addressability and mutability are clarified and detailed
in CSA note [utc1].

The following SVP terms are defined in CSA note [glo2] and reused in
this specification:

  adjacent threads
  - break
  - break type
  - continutation create
  - create
  - default place
  - family
  - global thread argument
  - global thread parameter
  - local place
  - place
  - shared thread argument
  - shared thread parameter
  - thread
  - thread function
  - thread index

Environment
===========

SL's translation and processing environments are defined like C's
environment, except that it uses M4 as a preprocessor instead of the C
preprocessor.

Also, the semantics of the SL abstract machine are altered by SVP; notably:

- signals and interrupts are not defined;

- memory consistency is defined differently;

- there exists synchronizing storage.

When program startup occurs, a family of a single thread is created
running thread function ``t_main``. ``t_main`` must be declared to
take no parameters, with break type ``void``.

Translation limits
------------------

C's translation limits apply. Also:

- the relative number of shared and global thread parameters or
  arguments that can be declared in a single declaration or create is
  *implementation-defined*;

Language
========

Concepts
--------

Scopes of identifiers
``````````````````````

*Identifiers* can denote a "normal C object"; a function; a tag or
member of a structure, union or enumeration; a typedef name; a label
name; a synchronizing object.

Identifiers have the same *visibility* and *scope* semantics in SL as
they have in C.

Linkage of identifiers
````````````````````````

*Linkage* is defined in SL as in C; identifiers for synchronizing objects
have no linkage.

Name space of identifiers
```````````````````````````

*Name spaces* are defined in SL as in C for all identifiers except
those to synchronizing objects.

It is *unspecified* whether SL shares the same namespace for C's
"ordinary identifiers" and identifiers that denote synchronizing
storage. (i.e. never assume the existence or absence of a shadowing
effect between the two sorts of identifier.)

It is also *unspecified* whether SL shares the same namespace for
identifiers that denote thread parameters and those that denote
arguments. (i.e. never assume the existence or absence of a shadowing
effect between the two sorts of identifiers).


Storage duration of objects
````````````````````````````

*Storage duration* is defined in SL as in C for "normal C objects". 

For synchronizing objects:

- the storage duration of a shared thread function parameter extends
  from the point execution starts in the thread function, to the point
  the execution of the thread ends or the next adjacent thread reads
  the object, whichever comes last.

- the storage duration of a thread function argument extends from the
  point of "create" in the parent, to the point execution leaves the
  block enclosing the "create" construct.

Binding between objects and identifiers
````````````````````````````````````````

See CSA notes [utc1], [utc2].

Types
``````

*Types* are defined in SL as in C. 

However SL adds a new type category: *thread function types*, which
are separate from C's function types. A thread function type is
characterized by its break type, and the number, class (shared/global)
and type of its parameters. A thread function type shall not be
incomplete. Thread function types can be used for type derivation like
function types.

Synchronizing objects can have any of C's *scalar types* (see ISO C99
for a definition). 

It is left *unspecified* whether a synchronizing object can have any
of C's other types (array, structure, union, function).

.. note:: in C a pointer-to-array type is a scalar type.

Representation of types
`````````````````````````

The *representation of types* is defined in SL as in C.

Compatible types and composite types
`````````````````````````````````````

*Compatible and composite types* are defined in SL as in C.

Additionally, compatibility and composition is extended to *thread
function types*. However:

- thread function types and C's function types are not mutually
  compatible;

- two thread function types are not compatible if their break type
  differ, of is their argument class and type differ in any manner
  when compared one to one in their order of appearance in the
  function's prototype.

Conversions
-----------

*Conversions* are defined in SL as in C.

Lexical elements
----------------

*Lexical elements* are defined in SL as in C, with the exception of
everything related to the C preprocessor.  SL's processor is M4.

Aditionally:

- all identifiers beginning with ``__sl_`` and ``_sl_`` are reserved
  and cannot be used in programs.

- the identifiers ``__file__``, ``__FILE__``, ``__line__``,
  ``__LINE__`` are reserved and their semantics are left
  *unspecified*.

- it is left *unspecified* whether SL supports
  *universal characters* as defined in ISO C99.

- the following preprocessor macros have pervasive semantics and must
  be considered as keywords (i.e. they must not be redefined, and they
  can be assumed to have the same semantics everywhere they appear)::

     sl_def sl_enddef sl_create sl_sync
     sl_shparm sl_glparm sl_shfparm sl_glfparm
     sl_glarg sl_glarg sl_shfarg sl_glfarg
     sl_seta sl_geta sl_setp sl_getp
     sl_break sl_kill sl_index

- the following additional keywords are reserved in SL and cannot be
  used in programs::

     create sync thread shared index kill family place

- any keyword in C++ not covered above is reserved in SL and cannot be
  used in programs.


Expressions
-----------

*Expressions* are defined in SL as in C, provided that any use of
objects described in their definition in C is considered restricted to
"normal C objects".

However, the following is left *unspecified*:

- whether C's function calls are valid SL expressions;

- whether C's use of ``/`` to divide two non-floating values is a
  valid SL expression. (see the section "Library" below for a substitute)

Additionally, the constructs ``sl_geta(x)`` and ``sl_getp(y)`` are
valid expressions if ``x`` and ``y`` are identifiers that refer to a
thread argument and parameter, respectively; as for semantics:

- they are defined to generate a *side effect* (i.e. their evaluation
  cannot be avoided even if their result is not used);

- they cause a read operation to the corresponding synchronizing
  object (see CSA notes [svp11], [svp6] for details);

- the result of their evaluation is a *rvalue* with the type and value
  of the synchronizing object after the read succeeds.

.. note:: the *identifiers* themselves that denote thread arguments
   and parameters are not valid expressions.

Constant expressions
--------------------

*Constant expressions* are defined in SL as in C.

Declarations
------------

The following *declarations* are defined in SL:

- any C-like declarations containing the storage type specifier
  ``typedef``, built upon any of C's types (i.e. not thread function
  types); these have the same semantics in SL as in C;

- any C-like declarations that declare or define a "normal C object";
  these have the same semantics in SL as in C;

- any C-like declaration that declare a structure, enum or union type;
  these have the same semantics in SL as in C;

- declarations of the form:

    ``sl_decl(`` *identifier* ``,`` *break-type* [ ``,`` *thread-param-list* ] ``)`` ``;``

  These *declare* a thread function with the specified identifier and
  prototype, with external linkage.

It is left *unspecified* whether any other of C's declarations exists in SL.

Statements and blocks
---------------------

*Statements and compound statements* are defined in SL as in C.

Additionally:

- a construct of the following form is a *block item* (not statement):

    ``sl_create(`` *create-parameters* ``,`` *expression* [ ``,`` *thread-arg-list* ] ``)`` ``;``

    *block-item-list*

    ``sl_sync(`` [ *expression* ] ``)`` ``;``

  Its constraints, semantics, and the restrictions on their
  composition with other C constructs, are defined in CSA notes
  [utc10], [utc11] and [utc13].

  It is left *unspecified* whether the create construct is well-formed
  when any of the expressions used in the create construct has
  side-effects and is not a simple assignment.

  .. note:: As this is "merely" a block item, braces are mandatory to
     turn it into a statement.

  .. note:: the whole construct (from ``sl_create`` to the semicolon
     after ``sl_sync``) is a *block item*; however it can "contain"
     additional block items inside itself (whose execution is bounded
     on entry by the create event and on exit by the sync event). With
     a restriction though: it is left *unspecified* whether the
     construct is valid if the block items inside it contain any
     expression with side effects other than simple assignments or
     uses of ``sl_set*``.

  .. note:: there cannot be a ``sl_create`` construct between a pair
     of ``sl_create`` and ``sl_sync``. (i.e. no nesting)

- a construct of the following form is a statement:

    ``sl_kill(`` *expression* ``)`` ``;``

  Its semantics are defined in CSA note [svp10].

- a construct of the following form is a statement:

    ``sl_break(`` *expression* ``)`` ``;``

  Its semantics and constraints are defined in CSA notes [utc11] and
  [svp10].

- a construct of either the following form is a statement:

    ``sl_seta(`` *identifier* ``,``  *expression* ``)`` ``;``

  or:

    ``sl_setp(`` *identifier* ``,``  *expression* ``)`` ``;``

  As statements, when they are executed they cause the evaluation of
  the expression then a write to the synchronizing object denoted by
  the identifier (resp. thread argument or parameter) using the value
  of the expression.

  .. note:: as described in CSA note [svp11] and [svp6] the position
     (and number) of reads and writes to synchronizing objects is
     restricted.

- The ``return`` statement cannot be used in a thread function
  definition.

.. note:: when passing an expression, the expression must not
   contain any commas, or it should be quoted with ``[[`` and
   ``]]``.

External definitions
--------------------

At the top level of a translation unit, the following of C's *external
declarations* are defined in SL as in C:

- declarations that declare or define "normal C objects";

- declarations with the storage class specifier ``typedef``.

- declarations that declare a structure, enum or union type;

- *thread function definitions* of the form:

    ``sl_def(`` *identifier* ``,`` *break-type* [ ``,`` *thread-param-list* ] ``)``

    *thread-function-body*

    ``sl_enddef``

  The break type must be specified with one of the three lexical words
  ``void``, ``int`` or ``float``. Despite the names, an actual break
  value type is guaranteed to be large enough to hold a pointer (for
  break type ``int``) or a C's ``double`` (for break type ``float``).

  The constraints and semantics of thread function definitions are
  defined in CSA notes [svp10], [utc11].

It is left *unspecified* whether SL supports C's function declarations
and definitions.



Preprocessing directives
------------------------

SL does not use the C preprocessor so C's semantics
w.r.t. preprocessing do not apply.

Instead SL uses mainly the M4 preprocessor. It is left *unspecified*
whether the C preprocessor is run on the program after it has been
filtered through M4. 

Additionally, M4's standard behavior is augmented with:

- GNU Autoconf's "m4sugar" macros (see Autoconf's documentation for details);

- some other "helper" macros (``m4_step``, ...) not documented here;

- an auxiliary macro ``sl_proccall`` defined as follows::

   m4_define([[sl_proccall]],
             [[do { 
                 sl_create(,,,,,,,$@); 
                 sl_sync(); 
               } while(0)]])

.. note:: M4's quotes in SL are ``[[`` and ``]]``.


Thread argument declarations
----------------------------

*Thread argument declarations* have either of the following forms:

  ``sl_glarg(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``,`` *expression* ``)``

  ``sl_glfarg(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``,`` *expression* ``)``

  ``sl_sharg(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* [ ``,`` *expression* ] ``)``

  ``sl_shfarg(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* [ ``,`` *expression* ] ``)``

*Thread parameter declarations* have either of the following syntactic forms:

  ``sl_glparm(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``)``

  ``sl_glfparm(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``)``

  ``sl_shparm(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``)``

  ``sl_shfparm(`` *declaration-specifiers* ``,`` *identifier* ``)``

The following *lexical* constraints apply: the
*declaration-specifiers* part must not contain any commas, unbalanced
parentheses nor colons. (if in doubt, use ``typedef`` before to
simplify the type to a single identifier)

.. note:: for the form that accept an expression, the expression must
   not contain any commas, or it should be quoted with ``[[`` and ``]]``.

Semantic constraints:

- the declaration specifiers must not contain any storage class specifier;

- the type qualifier ``volatile`` must not be used;

- the forms ``sl_glf*`` and ``sl_shf*`` must be used if and only if
  the declaration specifiers indicate any of C's real floating
  points;

- as described in the section "Concepts" above it is left *unspecified*
  whether a non-scalar type can be used for a thread argument
  declaration;

- additionally, it is left *unspecified* whether a thread argument
  declaration is valid if the expression (if it appears in the syntax)
  has side effects.

The semantics of thread arguments and parameters are described in CSA
notes [utc13], [utc11], [svp11] and [svp6].

Thread function body
--------------------

A *thread function body* has the following form:

  ``{`` [ ``sl_index(`` *identifier* ``)`` ``;`` ] *block-item-list* ``}``

It has the same semantics as a compound statement in C except that the
first block item may be a thread index declaration.

See CSA note [utc11] for more information about the syntax and note
[svp14] for more information about index values.


Library
=======

Introduction
------------

All of C's reserved identifiers are reserved in SL.

Additionally, the identifier ``main`` is reserved for top-level declarations.

Predefined SVP types and constants
----------------------------------

The following types are predefined:

- ``sl_family_t``: opaque type suitable to declare any object
  (including synchronizing objects) that can hold a SVP family
  identifier. The only operations defined for this type are comparison
  (equality) and assignment.

- ``sl_place_t``: opaque type suitable to declare any object
  (including synchronizing objects) that can hold a SVP place
  identifier. The only operations defined for this type are comparison
  (equality) and assignment.

The following constants are predefined:

- ``SVP_ENOERR``: equivalent to ``EXIT_NORMAL`` in µTC. Termination
  status when a family terminates normally.

- ``SVP_EKILLED``: equivalent to ``EXIT_KILLED`` in µTC. Termination
  status when a family terminates asynchronously due to the kill
  operation.

- ``SVP_EBROKEN``: equivalent to ``EXIT_BROKEN`` in µTC. Termination
  status when a family terminates asynchronously due to the break
  operation.

- ``PLACE_LOCAL``: specifier for the local place.

- ``PLACE_DEFAULT``: specifier for the default place. (note, this is
  the default when no place is specified in ``sl_create``)

General utilities
-----------------

The following definitions are available in ``svp/lib.slh``:

- "statement"-like macro ``svp_abort()``: causes the entire SVP
  environment to stop with an error condition when it is reached
  during execution of a thread.

- "statement"-like macro ``svp_nop()``: as its name implies causes the
  program to step forward with no side effect.

- "expression"-like macros ``likely(X)`` and ``unlikely(X)`` that can
  be used to guide branch optimization. See the provided macro
  definition and the description of ``__builtin_expect`` in the
  section "Other built-in functions provided by GCC" in the GCC
  documentation.

Diagnostics
-----------

The following definition is available in ``svp/assert.slh``:

- "statement"-like macro ``svp_assert(X)`` where ``X`` can be any
  scalar expression.

  If the preprocessor macro ``NDEBUG`` is not defined, ``svp_assert``
  expands to an empty statement. If the preprocessor macro ``NDEBUG``
  is defined, and execution reaches the point where ``svp_assert`` is
  used, and if the expression is false, then the macro writes
  information about the particular test that failed, then terminates
  the environment as per ``svp_abort()``.

Integer divide
--------------

The following definitions are available in ``svp/div.slh``:

- "Expression" macros (can be used as expressions, but may perform a
  side effect):

  ``divu(X, Y)``
    returns result of unsigned integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``

  ``modu(X, Y)``
    returns remainder of unsigned integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``

  ``divs(X, Y)``
    returns result of signed integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``

  ``mods(X, Y)``
    returns remainder of signed integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``

- "Statement" macros (can be used as statements):

  ``divmodu(X, Y)``
    performs unsigned integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``, then assign back
    the remainder to the first operand and the result to the second
    operand

  ``divmods(X, Y)``
    performs signed integer divide of ``X`` by ``Y``, then assign back
    the remainder to the first operand and the result to the second
    operand

.. note:: when passing an expression, the expression must not
   contain any commas, or it should be quoted with ``[[`` and
   ``]]``.
