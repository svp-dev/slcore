 Release notes for the SL demo and benchmark suite
===================================================

This document describes major updates to the package of SL demo
programs and benchmarks.

Version 2.2, December 2009
==========================

- The demo and benchmark suite is detached from the SL tool chain.

- New demo ``sep`` to demonstrate dynamic place allocation (CSA note
  [sl7]).

- New demo ``perf`` to demonstrate the new performance counter API
  (CSA note [sl8]).

- New demos ``keyblit`` and ``checkers`` to demonstrate the new gfx
  output API (CSA note [sl9]).

Benchmarking framework
----------------------

A common benchmarking framework is used by benchmark programs,
documented in CSA note [sl11]. This uses dynamic place allocation for
testing on varying number of cores and the new performance counter
API; it also reports results in the commonly agreed format suitable
for Unibench in the Apple-CORE project.

Additionally, new Automake rules in benchmark directories are provided
to run the benchmarks across a range of customizable inputs and
simulation parameters automatically. This can be used to reproduce
measurements using the standard ``make`` utility. 

"Simple" benchmark inputs (defining only a small amount of work) are
also used during ``make check`` as part of the unit testing. This can
be used to ensure that the benchmark code runs and produces results,
prior to running many and/or large experiments.

Livermore loop benchmarks
-------------------------

- Additional LMK implementations were provided by M. Hicks (loops 15,
  18-19, 21-23). 

- All LMK implementations were extended to support dynamic allocation
  of the input/output arrays.

- The code was optimized to use C99's ``restrict`` and VLA
  declarations where appropriate.

- Some LMK implementations were corrected or redesigned (loops 2-4,
  8, 11, 15, 19, 21, 23).

- The input data and wrapper code for for BLAS and LMK benchmarks is
  automatically generated.

Other benchmarks
----------------

- The FFT code was adapted to use the new benchmarking framework.

- New benchmark ``mandel`` (Mandelbrot set approximation), also uses
  the gfx API.

Version 2.1.0a, August 2009
===========================

- ``.sl`` files are converted to ``.c``.

- Demo programs now separated from benchmarks. The BLAS and FFT code
  are now benchmarks.

- New demo ``fibre`` for Fibre data input.

- Some LMK implementations were provided by M. Hicks (loops 1-14).

- New prototype implementations of the SHA-1, NAS IS and Quicksort
  algorithms.

Version 2.0.1a, June 2009
=========================

- New license (GPL v3).

- First version of BLAS code as demo programs.

- Provide 2nd implementation of FFT code using a smaller lookup table,
  courtesy of M. Lankamp.

Version 2.0.0a, May 2009
========================

- New demo `roman' for printing roman numerals.

- First version of FFT code as demo program.

- Rename demo ``fibo`` to ``fibonacci``.

- Compile each demo for multiple targets during ``make all``.

Version 2.x, February 2009
==========================

(No changes)

Version 1.x (utcc), December 2008
