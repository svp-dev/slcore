This directory contains the SL tool chain installer.

For details about its purpose and function, refer to CSA note [sl12].

Quick usage summary::

   ./configure
   make install -jN

The files are installed in versioned directories so that different
versions can be installed side-by-side. 

The script "slenv" is also installed and provides an interactive menu
to select one of the installed versions and setup environment
variables accordingly. 

The script "slversion" prints the configuration selected by "slenv"
(or manually). The script "deslenv" removes the configuration set by
"slenv".

When new versions of the tools are available, download a new installer
archive or use the ``--with`` command line parameters to the
``configure`` script (see ``configure --help``).
