	Merge the following changes.
	
	2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix handling of extra simulator command-line parameters.
	
	* tools/bin/slr.in: Properly parse `-Ws'. 
	
2009-07-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Be friendly with existing SL code.

	Current SL code (in .sl files) somehow depend on M4 being run
	before the C preprocessor. More specifically, it requires C
	preprocessor macro definitions (-DXXXX) to be expanded *after*
	processing by M4. This is incompatible with the latest changes
	which cause CPP to be run before M4. To alleviate the issue
	temporarily (until all .sl files are converted to the new
	ordering), the preprocessor macro definitions are added to the 2nd
	preprocessor run (compile, after M4). 

	This may cause issues if the macros at the 1st preprocessor run
	expand to text containing macro names, expecting CPP to not expand
	twice! This "feature" will be removed when the .sl extension is
	phased out entirely.
	
	* tools/bin/slc.in: Append $extra_ppflags to $slc_cflags when some
	.sl files are present in the input.

	* tools/lib/r-mtsparc-sim.sh.in: Print only the short utility name
	in warning and error messages, instead of the full path.	

        2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Provide test script for `quicksort' benchmark.

	* programs/benchmarks/quicksort/testqs.sh: New. It was mentioned
	in `Makefile.am' but nonexistent. 

        2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add shell goodies to the `slenv' script.

	* deploy/slenv: Also set `PS1' with bash and zsh to inform which
	version is currently selected.

2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Run M4 after the C preprocessor.

	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.

>>>>>>> master:ChangeLog

2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor packaging fix.
	
	* tools/bin/Makefile.am (bin_SCRIPTS): Ensure `slt-many' gets
	installed.

2009-07-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Use more bashisms to reduce the number of sub-processes spawned by
	tools.

	* tools/bin/slc.in,
	* tools/bin/cce.in,
	* tools/bin/slr.in,
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Use more $((...)) instead of $(expr ...). Use
	more ${foo#...} and ${foo%...} instead of cut and sed. Use "<<<"
	insted of "echo|".
	
2009-07-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix emission of `.base'.
	
	* tools/bin/spp: Wait until the register window is compressed and
	GP is renamed to emit `.base'.

2009-07-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Code generation improvements for MT-Alpha.

	* tools/bin/spp: Emit directive `.base' in prologue to signal that
	a non-standard GP register is being used. Reset `.base' to
	standard after `.end'. Do not force number of locals to 2 any more
	since the simulator bug this was supposed to work around has been
	fixed long ago.

2009-07-24  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Sanitize test suite. Make `slt' output more human-friendly.

	The tool `slt' would create output directories for log files and
	temporary files as direct sub-directories of the current directory
	always, with directories numbered after the test output
	columns (e.g. `___tests_0'). This would make the test output
	difficult to find when the input test (.sl) was located in a
	relative path. This was changed so that test output directories
	carry the name of the SL implementation being tested, and are
	structured in a hierarchy similar to the input test, possibly the
	same if building from the source tree directly (e.g. `tests/_seqc').

	The tool `slt-many' would pick up `slt' from PATH always, instead
	of the build directory as the other tools, resulting in `make
	check-slt' failing before the tools are installed in PATH or `eval
	$(make show-vars)' is run. This was fixed by handling tool
	locations like the other tools.

	* tools/bin/Makefile.am,
	* sl.mk: Introduce new tool location variable for `slt'.
	
	* tools/bin/slt-many: Rename to...	
	* tools/bin/slt-many.in: here. Handle copyright, bug reporting,
	version handling, tool locations, TRACE and PS4 like the other
	tools.

	* tools/bin/slt.in: Handle $SRCDIR. Document it.

	* tests.mk: Indicate $SRCDIR to `slt'. Set tool locations before
	invoking `slt-many'.

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix `make distcheck' after the integration of Livermore loops.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/arrays.h: Increase size of Du1,
	Du2, Du3 to LARGEST, since they are indexed in `k8.sl' up to the
	problem size.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am: Generate constant
	"filling" between the data items picked from array.h, as a
	possible safeguard against out-of-bound errors.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am,
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/genmk.sh: Do not distribute the
	test programs as they are properly auto-generated. Remove them on
	`make distclean'. Properly generate the Fibre inputs for the
	`bench' programs. Indicate that the Fibre input should be run with
	SLT_RUN in the `bench' programs.
	
2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	More developer-friendly SL tests.
	
	* tests.mk (check-slt): Make rule phony. Properly pick up tests
	either in source or build directory. Create dependency on test
	sources and Automake's `check_DATA'.

	* tools/bin/slt-many: Output the list of implementations being
	tested; separate implementation name, compile flags and run flags.

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Simplify the Livermore loop sources, optimize some.

	Previously *all* the arrays possibly used by all kernels were
	defined when compiling *each* kernel. Due to the relatively large
	array size selected to support large problem sizes at run-time,
	the resulting offsets in object code and executables would
	overflow linker abilities for weak linkers or on 32-bit systems.
	
	The code was refactored so that for each kernel the demonstration
	programs only include the array definitions actually required.

	Besides the `bench' and `test' programs a new `simple' program is
	provided for the benefit of testing code generation in the muTC
	core compiler.

	As a side change, some kernels were made more efficient through
	additional C99 `restrict' annotations on array pointers, which
	promise nice aliasing properties to the optimizing compilers.

	After this patch, some tests still fail due to either too large
	problem sizes (or too low default TIMEOUT) or offset errors.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livemore/main_simple.sl: New. This does not
	take parameters, and uses the predefined defaults.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/ll.slh: Move array definitions to...
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/arrays.h: here. Get rid of
	preprocessor aliases (`m4_define'), since the objects are now in
	the global namespace and the aliases would fool up SL macro
	expansions for special names (e.g. `ix', `ex').
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/gencode.sh: Move glue code generation into...
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am: here. Extract array
	definitions from `arrays.h' using a LL_USE annotation to be added in each
	kernel, listing the *names* of the required objects from `arrays.h'.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench13.bin.mtalpha.psize,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench14.bin.mtalpha.psize: New.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/gencode.sh: Rename to...
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/genmk.sh: here. Simplify some
	more; the .psize file must now exist for every source file.
	* bootstrap: Update accordingly.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/test.sl,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench.sl: Remove, as the glue code
	is now entirely dumped in each generated file by `Makefile.am'.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k1.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k2.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k3.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k4.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k5.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k6.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k7.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k8.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k9.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k10.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k11.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k12.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k13.sl,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k14.sl: Declare the required
	objects with a LL_USE annotation. Use the real object names not
	aliased names. Clean up whitespace. Use C99's `restrict' where
	appropriate.

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	More support for building out of the source tree (2).

	* tests.mk: Append `-I$(srcdir)' to the compile flags used by
	`slt'.	

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	More support for building out of the source tree.
	
	Fix compilation of SL programs when the main SL source is in
	$(builddir) and it includes some other files in $(srcdir). This
	appeared while testing auto-generation for SL code.
	
	* sl.mk: Append `-I$(srcdir)' to each invocation of `slc'. 

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix tests.

	* tools/tests/2_args/globpass.sl: Use `svp_nop' instead of
	`d_putchar' which was removed long ago.

2009-07-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Import more tests from previous `utcc' tree.
	
	* tools/tests/0_trivial/if3.sl,
	* tools/tests/2_args/globpass.sl,
	* tools/tests/2_args/shareuse.sl,
	* tools/tests/2_args/sumunsigned.sl: Import code from
	S. Polstra. Adapt to use SL macro names.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Update deployment makefiles to use latest simulator changes.
	
	* deploy/Makefile-reqs.orig (MGSIM_REV): Bump to r2513 with latest
	bug fixes.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Update deployment makefiles to use latest binutils changes.
	
	* deploy/Makefile-reqs.orig (BINUTILS_REV): Bump to r2430 where
	LDFP was introduced.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve deployment makefiles.
	
	* deploy/reqs.mk: Copy slenv to $(PREFIX) when needed. Move REPO
	variables to...	
	* deploy/Makefile-reqs.orig: here, so they can be customized.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Extend test suite.
	
	* tools/tests/2_args/twoways.sl: New. Inspired from discussion
	with T. Bernard.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Move forward with `make check' on LL benchmark code.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/ll.slh: Remove structure
	definition (put arrays in global scope) to prevent the compiler
	from complaining the structure is too large. Adjust LARGEST to
	please the linker on MacOS X.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench1.bin.mtalpha.psize,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench3.bin.mtalpha.psize,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench4.bin.mtalpha.psize,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench5.bin.mtalpha.psize,

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench11.bin.mtalpha.psize,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench12.bin.mtalpha.psize: Adapt
	problem size to new value of LARGEST.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/gencode.sh: Indicate to `slt' that
	the `bench' programs take Fibre input. Generate the Fibre data
	from the `.psize' files and distribute it. Indicate to `slt' that
	the output of the `test' programs should not be compared to the
	reference. Cleanup generated files on `make maintainerclean'

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES):
	Initialize variable so that `ll.mk' can append to it.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix distribution of LL benchmark code.	

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench.exp,

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/bench12.bin.mtalpha.psize: Import
	data from M. Hicks.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/gencode.sh: Generate dist rules
	for the ".psize" files.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	Distribute also `benchmarker.sh', `bench.exp' and the dependencies
	of test programs.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Extend the Livermore loop benchmarks, thanks to M. Hicks.

	* programs/benchmarks/ll/ll2.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/ll4.sl: Rename to...
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k2-alt.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k4-alt.sl: here.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k1.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k2.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k3.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k4.sl,

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k9.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k10.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k11.sl,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k12.sl,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k13.sl,	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/k14.sl: Import implementation from
	M. Hicks. Fix indent. Remove include and KERNEL definition.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/livermore.slh: Remove. Before
	deletion, split content into...
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/ll.slh: Array and parameter declarations,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/main_bench.sl: Main program for benchmarking,
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/main_test.sl: Main program for testing.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/gencode.sh: Generate benchmark and
	test sources that bind `ll.slh', the main program (`main_*.sl')
	and the specific kernel. Generate `ll.mk' with the list of
	generated sources.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/Makefile.am: New. Use
	auto-generated `ll.mk'.

	* programs/benchmarks/livermore/benchmarker.sh: Import
	implementation from M. Hicks. Adapt to new interface of benchmark
	programs.

	* programs/benchmarks/ll/Makefile.am: Remove, as is now obsolete.
	
	* configure.ac,
	* programs/benchmarks/Makefile.am: Remove reference to `ll',
	replace by `livermore'.

	* bootstrap: Run `gencode.sh' in `programs/benchmarks/livermore'.

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Update FFT benchmark to use the Fibre format.

	* programs/benchmarks/fft/fft_bench.sl: Take input from Fibre, not
	slr variables.

	* programs/benchmarks/fft/README: Document usage.
	
2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Beautify the SL compile process in Automake.

	* sl.mk: Use the '.x' file only a a stub, not as an interactive
	menu to choose the actual program from. Enable the shell's "-x"
	option in the compile function when running `make V=1' (verbose
	mode).

2009-07-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Library improvements.
	
	* tools/lib/t-ptl/include/sl_support.h: Define __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS and
	__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS early. This is required to enable C99 definitions
	in C standard headers when compiling in C++ mode.
	
	* lib/include/cstdint.slh: Add missing UINT*_MAX definitions.
	
	* lib/include/svp/perf.slh: Protect identifiers with underscores.

2009-07-20  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix linking against `mtalpha-sim/libslc.a' after the toolchain is
	installed.
	
	* tools/lib/mtalpha.mk: Pull libslc.a out of pkgdata_LIBRARIES,
	because otherwise Automake causes the host's "ranlib" utility to
	be run on the archive during installation. Use the DATA target
	instead.

2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Sanitize (more).

	* tools/bin/slc.in (TIMEOUT): Set a large default timeout, so that
	commands can have a chance to terminate by default (the timeout
	value is overriden by `slt').

	* Makefile.am (check-slt): Recurse `make all' only into `tools'
	and `lib'.

2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Optimizations in generated code for `ppp' target.
	
	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.addswchll): Remove special case for
	`$l1' when adding `swch' at the beginning of a function
	body. Recognize `ldfp' as an instruction that writes to its
	operand.

	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.protectend): Do not insert "nop" before
	"end", unless when adding "end" just after a label. This saves a
	cycle in most cases.

2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor fix in doc.
	
	* doc/HACKING.txt: Fix indent in last note. 

2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Distribute missing files. Pass `make distcheck' again.
	
	* programs/demo/Makefile.am: Distribute `fibre.sl.d{1,2,3}'.

	* tools/Makefile.am: Distribute `include/fibre.slh'.
	
2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Sanitize the make rules.
	
	* sl.mk: Rename make variable `SLC' to `SLC_RUN', so that rules in
	recursive runs are not confused when $SLC is set (e.g. from `make
	show-vars') in the environment.

	* lib/mtalpha.mk,
	* lib/ptl.mk,
	* lib/seqc.mk,
	* tools/lib/mtalpha.mk,
	* tools/lib/ptl.mk,
	* tools/lib/seqc.mk: Update accordingly.
	
2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add new rule `check-slt' for the eye candy, since `make check' now
	redirects the ASCII art to parallel log files.

	* Makefile.am: Introduce rule `check-slt' to run `slt' on the
	console (previously documented in `doc/HACKING.txt') for all
	source directories that include `tests.mk'.

	* tests.mk: Support `check-slt' in each directory defining tests.

	* tools/bin/slt-many: Ignore names starting with an underscore, so
	as to avoid itself to pick up remaining temporaries from a
	previous run. Avoid counting extra whitespace in test count.


2009-07-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Sanitize scripts. Simplify code, ease debugging.
	
	* tools/bin/timeout.in,
	* tools/bin/slc.in,
	* tools/bin/slr.in,
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Enable shell tracing (`set -x') when
	env. var. TRACE is set (used for debugging).

	* doc/HACKING.txt: Document the feature.

	* tools/bin/timeout.in: Major redesign to simplify and get signal
	management and exit codes right. Processes now killed gracefully
	(SIGTERM) once before SIGKILL.

	* tools/bin/slt.in: Detect SIGTERM in child as timeout.

	* tools/bin/slr.in: Use similar process management as in
	`timeout'. The cleanup now happens in a background process instead
	of a trap. Document the different steps.
	
	* tools/bin/slc.in: Use `timeout' to start compiler sub-processes,
	so that they get terminated eventually when run from `slt' with
	TIMEOUT set. Trap on SIGHUP as well.
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Do not prefix `timeout' to `slc', since `slc'
	takes care of aborting on its own.

	* tools/lib/r-host.sh,
	* tools/lib/r-mtalpha-sim.sh.in,	
	* tools/lib/r-mtsparc-sim.sh.in: Protect with `set -u' against
	bugs. Update variable accesses accordingly.

	* tools/bin/slt.in: Do not dump logs when terminating due to
	signal. List remaining files in all cases. Support .S as a test
	extension.
	
2009-07-17  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Reintroduce the `test-all' script from previous project `utcc',
	rename to `slt-many'. This eases applying `slt' on a batch of test
	files or directories on the command line.
	
	* tools/bin/slt-many: Reinstate `test-all'. Change to use `slt'
	instead of `test1'. Handle signals properly. Credit
	S. Polstra. Update bug report info, copyright.
	
	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Distribute and install it. Be careful
	when generating man pages, `slt-many' is not a derived file.

2009-07-17  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor packaging update.
	
	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Make the generated scripts depend on
	`ChangeLog', which carries the version information. Generate man
	pages only in maintainer mode.
	
2009-07-17  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* programs/benchmarks/Makefile.am,
	* configure.ac: Update accordingly.

2009-07-17  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Update to the new `ldfp' mechanism in the Microgrid
	simulator. This break compatibility of the generated code with
	older simulator versions.
	
	* tools/bin/spp: Use `ldfp' to initialize the stack pointer when
	needed. Initialize the frame pointer to zero, since there is not
	caller context.

	* tools/lib/mtalpha-sim/callgate.s: Use `ldfp' to initialize $30
	and $15.
	
2009-07-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix bugs in Fibre handling, add Fibre tests.
	
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Substitute "TEST" with the test's source file
	name in the SLT_RUN additional argument list.
	
	* programs/demo/fibre.sl,
	* programs/demo/fibre.sl.d1,
	* programs/demo/fibre.sl.d2,
	* programs/demo/fibre.sl.d3: Add Fibre example code.
	
	* programs/demo/Makefile.am (DEMOS): Update accordingly.

	* tools/bin/sag (FibreGenerator.dim): Support empty arrays
	properly.

	* tools/bin/slr.in: Insert tag -1 for Fibre index 0 if no Fibre
	data is provided. Use `mkdir -p' for temporary directories.
	
2009-07-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* configure.ac: Do not reference `cm4.in' as it does not yet
	exist.

2009-07-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Bug fixes, better support for Fibre input.
	
	* lib/include/svp/iomacros.slh: Handle case where `printf' is used
	with only a format string.

	* tools/bin/slr.in: Support reading Fibre data from standard input. 

	* tools/bin/sag (FibreGenerator),
	* tools/include/fibre.slh: Use the SAC vocabulary: "rank", "shape".

	* tools/bin/sag (SlrVarGenerator),
	* tools/bin/slr.in: Fix handling of "-l".

2009-07-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic changes.
	
	* deploy/reqs.mk: Use `svn export' instead of `svn co' as
	recommended by M. Irfanuddin.
	* deploy/Makefile-reqs.orig: Bump desired revisions.	

2009-07-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Use Automake's new "parallel tests" feature. This uses
	multiple cores more effectively than slt's internal
	parallel process spawning.
	
	* configure.ac: Enable option `parallel-tests'.
	* tests.mk: Use `LOG_COMPILER' instead of `TESTS_ENVIRONMENT'.
	
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Introduce new options `DUMP_LOGS' and
	`SEQUENTIAL'. Document them.
	* tests.mk: Use them.

2009-07-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic changes.
	
	* tools/lib/r-host/run.sh: Rename to...
	* tools/lib/r-host.sh: here.

	* configure.ac: Update accordingly.

2009-07-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Some more benchmark code.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/quicksort/am-quicksort-iterative.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/quicksort/sah-quicksort.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/quicksort/am-quicksort.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/Makefile.am: Add.

	* tools/lib/seqc.mk: Use AM_V_CC for $(CC).

2009-07-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor `slr' improvement.
	
	* tools/lib/r-host/run.sh,
	* tools/lib/r-mtalpha-sim/run.sh.in,	
	* tools/lib/r-mtsparc-sim/run.sh.in: Prefix $RUNNER_PREFIX to
	command lines, to allow e.g. "time" to be used on programs.
	
	* tools/bin/slr.in: Document it.

2009-07-01  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Make `slc' look more like GCC's front-end.
	
	* tools/bin/slc.in: Run C compiler even if no input files are
	provided; this to allow -dumpversion, etc. Refuse -M and -MM, but
	be graceful with -M[GPDTQF]. Properly handle -include and other -i
	preprocessor flags. Pass -W*, -d*, -pedantic, -ansi, -std* to both
	preprocessor and compiler. Handle input from `-' (standard input).

2009-06-29  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic fixes.

	* Makefile.am: Fix rule `show-vars': add `tools/bin/' to PATH, not
	`bin/'.

	* configure.am: Define new conditional ENABLE_DEMOS for building
	SL programs during `make all'.

	* Makefile.am,
	* programs/benchmarks/blas/Makefile.am,
	* programs/benchmarks/fft/Makefile.am,
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/Makefile.am,
	* programs/demo/Makefile.am: Use it.

	* programs/benchmarks/blas/blas-test-saxpy.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/ll2.sl,

	* doc/NEWS.txt: Mention benchmark programs.
	
2009-06-29  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Small fixes.
	
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/ll2.sl,
	* programs/benchmarks/ll/ll4.sl: Implement some more benchmarks.

	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.remdefaults): Default place is now 0 as
	per [svp27], not 1.

2009-06-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* tools/lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Update PLACE_LOCAL
	with definition from [svp27].

	* tools/lib/t-utc0/slimpl.m4: Replace definition of `sl_decl' to
	avoid emitting a dangling brace after the declaration, as would
	happen when reusing `sl_def' blindly.

2009-06-24  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* tools/bin/Makefile.am (cce.1 slc.1 slr.1 slt.1): Revert previous
	change since the temporary files are different anyways. Give
	absolute pathname to help2man.

2009-06-24  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* tools/bin/Makefile.am (cce.1 slc.1 slr.1 slt.1): Use different
	temporary file names to avoid race condition with script build
	rule.

	missing exit status codes to uses of `die'.

2009-06-22  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Implement Fibre input.

	* include/fibre.slh: Add.

	'lda').
	
	* lib/host-host-seqc/load.c: Give target pointer to set as
	parameter to support loading multiple files.
	* lib/host-host-seqc/slrt.c,
	* lib/host-host-ptl/slrt.c: Use it to load both SLR vars data and
	Fibre data.

	multiple settings anyways.	
	
2009-06-19  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* bin/cce.in (slc_cflags): Use IEEE-compliant math compile flags.

	the expression value as a comment; this allows to use more complex
	expressions potentially containing newlines in the second operand
	to `sl_setp'.

	trace instead of -x.
	* bin/slt.in: Update accordingly.

	* bin/slr.in: Support new options -r and -w to load/save the data
	file from a file. This allows to cache an input data file between
	runs.

	contain version information.

	

2009-06-08  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix major bug found by Mike H. in "alternate compiler".
	
	* bin/spp: Fix bug where special registers (GP etc) would be

	* demo/Makefile.am,
	* tests.mk: Simplify. Move generic rules to...
	* sl.mk: here.

	* Makefile-reqs.orig,

2009-05-19  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic changes. Reinstate support for compiling through the MG
	core compiler. Reinstate "xfail" tests.
	
	* tests/0_minimal/0_trivial/div.sl: Rename to...	
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div3.sl: here, because div requires create
	and arguments.
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.create): 
	* lib/t-utc0/include/sl_support.h,
	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,
	* tests/1_basic/3_args/gencall.py,		
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div2.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div3.sl: Use "long" instead of "long
	long" to simplify code since they are the same size on the Alpha.

	* include/svp/perf.slh,
	* include/climits.slh,
	* include/cstdint.slh,		
	* include/cstddef.slh: Test for __mtalpha__ in addition to
	__alpha__ to support the MG core compiler.

	* lib/t-utc0/slimpl.m4: Use m4_foreach instead of manual recursion
	to avoid issues with quoting. Check more for matching create/sync
	blocks, as with ptl and ppp.

	PLACE_DEFAULT. 

	* lib/t-utc0/include/sl_support.h,

2009-05-18  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Allow for more debugging & more tests.

	* lib/seqc.mk,	
	* lib/ptl.mk: Compile with CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, which can be
	overridden by configure. This also captures configure's defaults
	of -g -O2, suitable for debugging of the SVP library.

	* tests/0_minimal/3_mem/floatsh.sl,
	* tests/0_minimal/3_mem/floatsh1.sl,	
	* tests/0_minimal/3_mem/floatsh2.sl: Add, based on report by
	M. Hicks.
	
2009-05-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* lib/svplib/roman.sl: Simplify.

2009-05-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Make debugging easier.

	* bin/slr.in: Rename option -x to -c. Use -x for new "tracing"
	feature (print commands before running them). Add option -g to run
	command with debugger. Improve documentation to reflect the
	feature changes.

	* lib/r-mtalpha-sim/run.sh.in,
	* lib/r-mtsparc-sim/run.sh.in,
	* lib/r-host/run.sh: Recognize VERBOSE, DEBUG and DEBUGGER. 
	
	* bin/slt.in: Always put temporary file in a subdirectory of the
	current directory, instead of the source directory. This makes
	TEST_HERE obsolete. Give -x to `slr' for better logging.
	
	* tests.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Simplify accordingly. 

	* bin/slr.in,
	* bin/slc.in: Better use TMPDIR and mktemp to reduce the size of
	temporary directory paths.
	
2009-05-13  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* Makefile.am: Distribute Makefile-reqs.orig and Makefile-reqs.mk.

2009-05-11  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve support for C99. Start implementing math primitives.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Define __mt_freestanding__ when cross-compiling to
	mt*-sim.
	
	* include/cstddef.h,
	* include/cstdint.h,
	* include/cstdbool.h,
	* include/climits.h,	
	* include/svp/minimath.slh: Use it. Implement more C99
	features. Implement some math.

	* bin/cce.in: Give arch-specific compiler flags to GCC-Alpha to
	make faster assembly by default, especially inline of math
	functions.	
	* lib/mtalpha.mk,
	* demo/Makefile.am: Simplify accordingly.

2009-05-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic fixes.
	
	* tests.mk: Avoid testing `utc' if `ENABLE_MTALPHA' is not
	set. This avoids testing `utc' if the muTC compiler is not found.

	* configure.ac: Fix typos.
	
2009-05-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Cosmetic fixes.
	
	* Makefile.am (show-vars): Update PATH as well to allow using
	`slc', `slr' etc directly on the command line instead of $SLC,
	$SLR etc. Make target suitable input for a shell's `eval' builtin.

	* doc/HACKING.txt: Update accordingly.
	
	* configure.ac: Fix typo ("slr" instead of "sgr").
	* doc/README.txt: Fix typo ("demo" instead of "demos").	
	
2009-05-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve portability and support for degraded environments (where
	all tools are not present).
	
	* configure.ac: Refuse to configure if Python is not there.

	* bin/Makefile.am,
	* bin/slc.in: Use M4 as detected by "configure".

	* tests.mk,	
	* demo/Makefile.am: Use Automake conditionals to exclude tests
	that cannot be run due to missing tools.

2009-04-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* bin/timeout.in (usage): Fix typo, as reported by mlankamp.

2009-04-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Small optimization.
	
	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Avoid forcing creating a
	temporary when the incoming shared is the direct right hand side
	of an assignment to an outgoing shared. This optimizes direct
	shared assignments of the form `sl_setp(x, sl_getp(x))'.

2009-04-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix handling of multiple sources / objects on the command line for
	`slc'.
	
	* bin/slc.in: Fix substitution of separator in dependency list
	when processing a single step of the build chain.

2009-04-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Simplify use of `slr'.
	
	* bin/slr.in: Reinstate possibility to specify program variables
	directly by specifying the variable name, next to (in addition to)
	-d. Update documentation accordingly.

	* demo/fft.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/roman.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: Simplify accordingly.

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve printf(). 

	Until now printf() would expect all integers to be passed as "long
	long", and all floats to be passed as "double", which required
	explicit casts for arguments of other types. This is now
	corrected, by having the size of each argument computed at the
	point of use and passed as argument to printf. The interface now
	looks and feels more C's native printf().

	* include/cstdint.slh,
	* include/svp/argslot.slh,
	* include/svp/io.slh,
	* include/svp/iomacros.slh,
	* lib/svplib/io.sl: Fix printf.

	* demo/answer.sl,
	* demo/10threads.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl: Simplify accordingly.	

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Code cleanup.
	
	* include/slr.slh: Give the type of the input data structure a
	name. This prevents a compiler warning when compiling via
	C++. Have slr_var take the type before the variable name, as is
	customary in C.

	* demo/roman.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: Update accordingly.

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve documentation.
	
	* bin/slr.in: Better documentation.
	
	* bin/sag: Better handle listing of program variables.

	* doc/NEWS.txt: Mention `slr'.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* lib/t-pppalpha/slimpl.m4: Mark sync as clobbering the whole
	memory, so that any variable is forcibly re-read from memory after
	the sync. This prevents the compiler from caching the memory
	values in registers across a sync.

	* tests/0_minimal/3_mem/sideeffect.sl: Add test for this bug.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Make `slr' recognize variable definitions using command line
	argument of form "-dVAR" or "-dVAR=..." as recommended by
	C. Grelck. Update documentation. Minor bug fix in `slt'.

	* bin/slr.in: Handle command line differently. Document it.

	* demo/roman.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl: Update accordingly.

	bad integer expression in `test' later.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>
	Transitory fix requested by M. Hicks.
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.makespecial): Use "ldgp" if no gpdisp number
	is available.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Transitory fix requested by M. Hicks.
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.makespecial): For prologue detection,
	recognize a single "ldgp" macro as well instead of only 2
	instructions. This may allow to use GCC 4.1 as Alpha
	cross-compiler.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improvements to test engine and documentation. Minor cleanup.
	
	* bin/slt.in: Allow specifying implementation names via an
	environment variable. Provide (cleaner) mechanism to add extra
	args for compilation and execution. Properly handle runtime
	failure when a test code requires multiple test runs. Document the
	features.

	* bin/slt.in: Reorganize documentation sections so that the manual
	page looks nice.

	* configure.ac: Add new parameters --enable-check-utc and
	--disable-check-ppp that set Automake conditionals.
	
	* tests.mk: Based on conditionals set by configure, either ignore
	or use the test results for the muTC core compiler and PPP core
	compiler.

	* bin/slt.in: Take location of `slr' from Autoconf variable.
	* bin/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Use the regular "mtalpha-sim" back-end for the muTC
	core compiler, since the code to be run there can be compiled with
	the alternate compiler and should not use a different calling
	convention.
	
	* lib/mtalpha-sim-proto: Kill tree as is now unused.

	* bin/slr.in,
	* bin/slc.in,
	* bin/cce.in: Add warranty disclaimer.

	demo. Fix bugs thanks to testing.
	
	* include/svp/perf.slh: Implement primitive to read the cycle
	counter.

	* include/cstdint.slh: Define some types manually when running
	Alpha, since stdint.h is not available then. This needs to be
	improved later.

	some computations when input parameter Pc is set. Separate output
	of each array for more meaningful "diff".
	
	* demo/testfft.sh: Update accordingly.
	
	* demo/fft_gentable.c: Generate more table entries (M=11).

	* demo/Makefile.am: Reinstate fft during "make check".
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.optprologue): Be more careful when optimizing
	FP initialization: only remove the spilling instruction, not

	sl_create. Fix handling of places.

2009-04-02  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improvements to unit test script (`slt'). Restore 'make distcheck'
	again.

	Make it possible to 1) set expected failures for specific
	implementations using pattern matching, 2) disregard a test phase
	regardless of its status (XIGNORE), 3) indicate to `slt' that
	there should be multiple executions of the program with different
	sets of parameters to `sgr' (SLT_RUN).

	See "slt --help" for details.
	
	* bin/slt.in: Implement extra features. Document them.
	
	* bin/sgr.in: Relax argument parsing. Can now interleave program
	variables and simulator parameters.

	* demo/10threads.sl,	
	* tests/0_minimal/2_args/delayshared.sl: use XIGNORE with ptl
	since ptl does not implement the delayed shared sets properly.

	compiler during "make distcheck"

	* tests/1_basic/0_sgr_args/args.sl: Test the "sgr program
	variables" mechanism.
	
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: use the new SLT_RUN mechanism.

	break and this is not properly designed in SL yet.

	* Makefile.am: Do not forget to distribute sgr.slh.

2009-03-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	First "working" implementation of parameter passing for SL
	programs. 

	* bin/sag: Use C syntax instead of assembly for data source
	code. Fix case where an empty list is specified as
	initializer. Print help on standard error.

	* lib/arggen.sl: Add.

	* include/sgr.slh: Add.
	
	* bin/sgr.in: Better error handling. Compute data source file
	based on command line, `sag' and the sgr specifiers in the program
	binary from `sgr.slh'. Use `sgr_datatag' in binary as arch name to
	compile data source file and `arggen.sl', then recurse to generate
	the data. Define parameter -Ws to pass arguments to simulator.
	
	* lib/host-host-seqc/slrt.c,
	* lib/host-host-ptl/slrt.c,	
	* lib/mtalpha-sim/slrt.s: Define "sgr_datatag" in output binary.

	* demo/fibonacci.sl: Use the new parameter system.
	
	* demo/fft.sl: Use the new parameter system. Allow to skip
	printing the data after the computation based on the value of
	parameters Pi (print ints) and Pf (print floats).

	* demo/testfft.sh: Add script to benchmark the fft, based on the
	new parameter system.
	* demo/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	
	* lib/div: Kill, as is now unused.
	* bin/cce.in: Better handling of unknown tags.

	sparc binutils before mgsim.

2009-03-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve compatibility with Ubuntu.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Add slrt.o before -lsos in link flags, since slrt
	can depend on -lsos and Ubuntu has strict linker semantics.

	* configure.ac: Lower Autoconf requirement to 2.61, which is
	reasonably recent (later than 2.60) and pleases Ubuntu users.

	* doc/requirements.txt: Document extra requirements for building
	documentation, with highlight on Debian/Ubuntu package names.

	* bin/slt.in, 
	* bin/timeout.in: Print a newline before the "interrupted by
	signal" message, to clean up terminal.

2009-03-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

2009-03-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Bug fixes thanks to testing.
	
	* bin/spp: Recognize cvt*, itof* and ftoi* instructions as
	instructions that overwrite their 2nd parameter (like "mov"). This
	avoids unneeded swch annotations. Recognize "blbc" as branch
	instruction.

	* lib/svplib/io.sl: Use "const char*" instead of "char*" to please
	the compiler.

2009-03-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix handling of long argument lists.

	* bin/spp: Add missing shared registers (df5, sf5) for FP shared
	passing. Restore original intended values for the magic
	numbers (11 and 12, resp). Strip whitespace from thread function
	parameter names, so that the m4 macro names for the
	setters/getters do not contain whitespace either. In mapcall(),
	properly double #shareds in checks. Make the structure that holds
	extra arguments "volatile" to force the compiler to emit the
	stores on time. Use "__restrict__" instead of "restrict".

	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Tell the compiler in
	__sl_getshp that the same register can be used for the dependent
	shared after the volatile asm has been reached (allows for more
	optimization).

	* tests/1_basic/3_args/gencall.py: Add test case generator.

	Improve requirements "Makefile" to download sparc binutils (they
	are not needed yet, this is an investment for later).
	
	* bin/slt: Add new output mode: sequential text only (no control
	codes), enabled with a non-empty environment variable
	TEXT_ONLY. Document it in --help.

	* Makefile-reqs.mk: Add rules to fetch sparc/mtsparc binutils.

2009-03-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	More bug fixes thanks to Andrei Matei.

	* bin/cce.in: Use $slc_libdir to find the slrt and library, not
	$slc_datadir.
	
	* bin/slc.in: Give a source file's directory as extra -I to m4 to
	allow m4_include's to work a bit more like CPP's #include "".
	
	* configure.ac: Search for a suitable $(LN_S).	
	* doc/Makefile.am: Use it. Fixes use of picture in document when
	building in a separate directory.

	* configure.ac: The Sparc utilities have architecture name
	mtsparc-leon-linux, not mtsparc-linux-gnu.

	* Makefile.am: Extract more rules outside of the maintainer mode,
	as suggested by Andrei.

	* tests.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Run "slt" with $(SHELL), so that
	extra shell arguments can be passed on the command line of "make
	check".

	* doc/requirements.txt,
	* Makefile-reqs.orig: Remove overload of MAKEINFO, as the binutils
	now detect it properly. Remove dependency on Alpha sysroot.

	rules to...
	* Makefile-reqs.mk: here. Simplify. Patch up GCC's Makefile as

	(now FFT works from source in simulator!)
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.lexer): Do not remove duplicate whitespace, as
	it may be legitimate (e.g. in .ascii). Recognize FP branch
	instructions.

	* demo/fft.sl: Change algorithm, as previous algorithm was not
	thread-safe. Convert FP numbers to integers before printing, to
	work around bug in FP print function.	
	* demo/fft_gentable.c: Update for new algorithm.

	suite (all failures are not properly reported by all
	implementations, but we want to ignore this for now and focus on
	the positive features).
	
	* demo/fibonacci.sl: Reduce N to fit execution time within 5
	seconds (timeout during tests).

	More tests & improvements thanks to testing.
	
	* bin/spp,
	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,
	* lib/t-pppalpha/slimpl.m4: Declare thread arguments in a single
	namespace before the create, to catch multiple definitions of the
	same identifier. Copy the thread arguments to a new temporary
	after the sync, so that further references use the temporary
	instead of the variable shared with the child family (which could
	be reused via a register for a new family).

	continuation creates (3rd create parameter in PTL).

	* bin/spp (pppalpha.addswchll): Recognize more instructions that
	cause a long latency operation (esp. FP ops). Avoid swch after
	"setempty" which does not read its register.
	
	* doc/acronyms.txt: Document 'slt'. 

	* bin/slt: Properly use TEST_HERE.

	by default.

	* include/svp/lib.slh: Fix definition of "unlikely".

	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,

	registers lists. Bark when "jsr" is found in the output.

	* lib/mtalpha-sim/include/svp_os.h: Insert "nop"'s before the halt
	instruction, as it causes a decode error in the pipeline and may
	cause a failure in the delay slot after a branch.

	binutils.

	* include/svp/lib.slh: Encapsulate __abort differently.
