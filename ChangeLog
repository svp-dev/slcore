2009-04-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Small optimization.
	
	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Avoid forcing creating a
	temporary when the incoming shared is the direct right hand side
	of an assignment to an outgoing shared. This optimizes direct
	shared assignments of the form `sl_setp(x, sl_getp(x))'.

2009-04-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix handling of multiple sources / objects on the command line for
	`slc'.
	
	* bin/slc.in: Fix substitution of separator in dependency list
	when processing a single step of the build chain.

2009-04-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Simplify use of `slr'.
	
	* bin/slr.in: Reinstate possibility to specify program variables
	directly by specifying the variable name, next to (in addition to)
	-d. Update documentation accordingly.

	* demo/fft.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/roman.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: Simplify accordingly.

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve printf(). 

	Until now printf() would expect all integers to be passed as "long
	long", and all floats to be passed as "double", which required
	explicit casts for arguments of other types. This is now
	corrected, by having the size of each argument computed at the
	point of use and passed as argument to printf. The interface now
	looks and feels more C's native printf().

	* include/cstdint.slh,
	* include/svp/argslot.slh,
	* include/svp/io.slh,
	* include/svp/iomacros.slh,
	* lib/svplib/io.sl: Fix printf.

	* demo/answer.sl,
	* demo/10threads.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl: Simplify accordingly.	

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Code cleanup.
	
	* include/slr.slh: Give the type of the input data structure a
	name. This prevents a compiler warning when compiling via
	C++. Have slr_var take the type before the variable name, as is
	customary in C.

	* demo/roman.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: Update accordingly.

2009-04-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* bin/slr.in: Better documentation.
	
	* bin/sag: Better handle listing of program variables.

	* doc/NEWS.txt: Mention `slr'.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* lib/t-pppalpha/slimpl.m4: Mark sync as clobbering the whole
	memory, so that any variable is forcibly re-read from memory after
	the sync. This prevents the compiler from caching the memory
	values in registers across a sync.

	* tests/0_minimal/3_mem/sideeffect.sl: Add test for this bug.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Make `slr' recognize variable definitions using command line
	argument of form "-dVAR" or "-dVAR=..." as recommended by
	C. Grelck. Update documentation. Minor bug fix in `slt'.

	* bin/slr.in: Handle command line differently. Document it.

	* demo/roman.sl,
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* demo/fft.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/0_slr_args/args.sl: Update accordingly.	

	* bin/slt.in (check_status): Initialize $signal to 0 to avoid a
	bad integer expression in `test' later.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>
	Transitory fix requested by M. Hicks.
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.makespecial): Use "ldgp" if no gpdisp number
	is available.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Transitory fix requested by M. Hicks.
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.makespecial): For prologue detection,
	recognize a single "ldgp" macro as well instead of only 2
	instructions. This may allow to use GCC 4.1 as Alpha
	cross-compiler.

2009-04-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improvements to test engine and documentation. Minor cleanup.
	
	* bin/slt.in: Allow specifying implementation names via an
	environment variable. Provide (cleaner) mechanism to add extra
	args for compilation and execution. Properly handle runtime
	failure when a test code requires multiple test runs. Document the
	features.

	* bin/slt.in: Reorganize documentation sections so that the manual
	page looks nice.

	* configure.ac: Add new parameters --enable-check-utc and
	--disable-check-ppp that set Automake conditionals.
	
	* tests.mk: Based on conditionals set by configure, either ignore
	or use the test results for the muTC core compiler and PPP core
	compiler.

	* bin/slt.in: Take location of `slr' from Autoconf variable.
	* bin/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Use the regular "mtalpha-sim" back-end for the muTC
	core compiler, since the code to be run there can be compiled with
	the alternate compiler and should not use a different calling
	convention.
	
	* lib/mtalpha-sim-proto: Kill tree as is now unused.

	* bin/slr.in,
	* bin/slc.in,
	* bin/cce.in: Add warranty disclaimer.
	* bin/slt.in: Update licensing info and add warranty disclaimer.

2009-04-05  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* bin/slt.in: Properly set error condition when any but the last
	run fail.

	* Makefile.am: Do not forget to distribute `include/svp/perf.slh'.

2009-04-03  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add new performance measurement API to the SL library. Improve FFT
	demo. Fix bugs thanks to testing.
	
	* include/svp/perf.slh: Implement primitive to read the cycle
	counter.

	* include/cstdint.slh: Define some types manually when running
	Alpha, since stdint.h is not available then. This needs to be
	improved later.

	* demo/fft.sl: Use new performance measurement mechanism. Skip
	some computations when input parameter Pc is set. Separate output
	of each array for more meaningful "diff".
	
	* demo/testfft.sh: Update accordingly.
	
	* demo/fft_gentable.c: Generate more table entries (M=11).

	* demo/Makefile.am: Reinstate fft during "make check".
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.optprologue): Be more careful when optimizing
	FP initialization: only remove the spilling instruction, not
	potential loads from SP. (discovered when running FFT)

	* bin/spp (pppalpha.addswchll): Recognize "rpcc" as an instruction
	which overwrites its operand with no read.

	* bin/spp (pppalpha.filter): Rename more locals to squeeze window
	some more (also fp, ra, pv, rv).

	* lib/mtalpha.mk,
	* demo/Makefile.am: Set additional Alpha optimization flags.

	* bin/cce.in: Use -O2 by default, not -Os.

	* bin/sag (genasm): Emit structure names to please C++ compiler

	as to not forget to read the last byte of data.

	* lib/t-pppalpha/slimpl.m4: Remove redundant definition of
	sl_create. Fix handling of places.

2009-04-02  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improvements to unit test script (`slt'). Restore 'make distcheck'
	again.

	Make it possible to 1) set expected failures for specific
	implementations using pattern matching, 2) disregard a test phase
	regardless of its status (XIGNORE), 3) indicate to `slt' that
	there should be multiple executions of the program with different
	sets of parameters to `sgr' (SLT_RUN).

	See "slt --help" for details.
	
	* bin/slt.in: Implement extra features. Document them.
	
	* bin/sgr.in: Relax argument parsing. Can now interleave program
	variables and simulator parameters.

	* demo/10threads.sl,	
	* tests/0_minimal/2_args/delayshared.sl: use XIGNORE with ptl
	since ptl does not implement the delayed shared sets properly.

	* tests.mk: use XIGNORE for utc0 to relieve pressure on muTC core
	compiler during "make distcheck"

	* tests/1_basic/0_sgr_args/args.sl: Test the "sgr program
	variables" mechanism.
	
	* demo/fibonacci.sl,
	* tests/1_basic/2_div/div.sl: use the new SLT_RUN mechanism.

	* tests/mkalltests.mk: disable index tests for now as they require
	break and this is not properly designed in SL yet.

	* Makefile.am: Do not forget to distribute sgr.slh.

2009-03-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	First "working" implementation of parameter passing for SL
	programs. 

	* bin/sag: Use C syntax instead of assembly for data source
	code. Fix case where an empty list is specified as
	initializer. Print help on standard error.

	* lib/arggen.sl: Add.

	* include/sgr.slh: Add.
	
	* bin/sgr.in: Better error handling. Compute data source file
	based on command line, `sag' and the sgr specifiers in the program
	binary from `sgr.slh'. Use `sgr_datatag' in binary as arch name to
	compile data source file and `arggen.sl', then recurse to generate
	the data. Define parameter -Ws to pass arguments to simulator.
	
	* lib/host-host-seqc/slrt.c,
	* lib/host-host-ptl/slrt.c,	
	* lib/mtalpha-sim/slrt.s: Define "sgr_datatag" in output binary.

	parameters Pi (print ints) and Pf (print floats).

	* demo/testfft.sh: Add script to benchmark the fft, based on the
	new parameter system.
	* demo/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	
	* lib/div: Kill, as is now unused.
	* bin/cce.in: Better handling of unknown tags.

	* bin/spp: Bug fix thanks to fibo & fft: remove FP/RA spill in
	function prologue. This provides (some) support for C99's VLAs.
	
2009-03-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* lib/host-host-seqc/load.c: Initialize argument pointer to 0 when
	no data file is specified, instead of aborting.
	
2009-03-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Start implementing parameter passing for SL programs.
	
	* bin/sag: Add.

	* Makefile-reqs.mk: Reorder dependencies of "all" to build the
	sparc binutils before mgsim.

2009-03-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve compatibility with Ubuntu.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Add slrt.o before -lsos in link flags, since slrt
	can depend on -lsos and Ubuntu has strict linker semantics.

	* configure.ac: Lower Autoconf requirement to 2.61, which is
	reasonably recent (later than 2.60) and pleases Ubuntu users.

	* doc/requirements.txt: Document extra requirements for building
	documentation, with highlight on Debian/Ubuntu package names.

	* bin/slt.in, 
	* bin/timeout.in: Print a newline before the "interrupted by
	signal" message, to clean up terminal.

2009-03-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	where /bin/sh is not bash (e.g. Ubuntu). Handle signals better
	during testing.
	
	* bin/slt: Rename to...	
	* bin/slt.in: Here. Announce dependency on bash. Better signal
	handling.
	
	* bin/timeout: Rename to...	
	* bin/timeout.in: Here. Announce dependency on bash. Better signal
	handling.
	
	* bin/Makefile.am,

2009-03-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Bug fixes thanks to testing.
	
	* bin/spp: Recognize cvt*, itof* and ftoi* instructions as
	instructions that overwrite their 2nd parameter (like "mov"). This
	avoids unneeded swch annotations. Recognize "blbc" as branch
	instruction.

	* lib/svplib/io.sl: Use "const char*" instead of "char*" to please
	the compiler.
	
2009-03-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	or standard library.
	
	* bin/slc.in: Handle -nostdlib, -nodefaultlibs,
	-nostartfiles. Document them.
	
	* bin/cce.in: Use variables slc_use_slrt and slc_use_slos provided

	* lib/seqc.mk,
	* lib/mtalpha.mk,
	* lib/ptl.mk: Use -nostdlib where appropriate.

	* bin/cce.in: Require slrt.o when -nostartfiles is not specified.

2009-03-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix handling of long argument lists.

	* bin/spp: Add missing shared registers (df5, sf5) for FP shared
	passing. Restore original intended values for the magic
	numbers (11 and 12, resp). Strip whitespace from thread function
	parameter names, so that the m4 macro names for the
	setters/getters do not contain whitespace either. In mapcall(),
	properly double #shareds in checks. Make the structure that holds
	extra arguments "volatile" to force the compiler to emit the
	stores on time. Use "__restrict__" instead of "restrict".

	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Tell the compiler in
	__sl_getshp that the same register can be used for the dependent
	shared after the volatile asm has been reached (allows for more
	optimization).

	* tests/1_basic/3_args/gencall.py: Add test case generator. 

	* tests/mkalltests.sh: Use it to generate more tests.

2009-03-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* doc/requirements.txt: Update accordingly.
	

2009-03-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve test script to support text only output (requested by
	Simon Polstra in utcc).

	Improve requirements "Makefile" to download sparc binutils (they
	are not needed yet, this is an investment for later).
	
	* bin/slt: Add new output mode: sequential text only (no control
	codes), enabled with a non-empty environment variable
	TEXT_ONLY. Document it in --help.

	* Makefile-reqs.mk: Add rules to fetch sparc/mtsparc binutils.

2009-03-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	More bug fixes thanks to Andrei Matei.

	* bin/cce.in: Use $slc_libdir to find the slrt and library, not
	$slc_datadir.
	
	* bin/slc.in: Give a source file's directory as extra -I to m4 to
	allow m4_include's to work a bit more like CPP's #include "".
	
	* configure.ac: Search for a suitable $(LN_S).	
	* doc/Makefile.am: Use it. Fixes use of picture in document when
	building in a separate directory.

	* configure.ac: The Sparc utilities have architecture name
	mtsparc-leon-linux, not mtsparc-linux-gnu.

	* Makefile.am: Extract more rules outside of the maintainer mode,
	as suggested by Andrei.

	* tests.mk (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Run "slt" with $(SHELL), so that
	extra shell arguments can be passed on the command line of "make
	check".

	* doc/requirements.txt: List requirements for building the
	documentation.
	
2009-03-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Simplify installation of prerequisites. No more Alpha/Linux
	sysroot is required.
	
	* doc/requirements.txt,
	* Makefile-reqs.orig: Remove overload of MAKEINFO, as the binutils
	now detect it properly. Remove dependency on Alpha sysroot.

	* Makefile-reqs.orig: Split and separate configuration-dependent
	rules to...
	* Makefile-reqs.mk: here. Simplify. Patch up GCC's Makefile as
	necessary to prevent failures in the absence of a sysroot.

	(now FFT works from source in simulator!)
	
	* bin/spp (pppalpha.lexer): Do not remove duplicate whitespace, as
	it may be legitimate (e.g. in .ascii). Recognize FP branch
	instructions.

	* demo/fft.sl: Change algorithm, as previous algorithm was not
	thread-safe. Convert FP numbers to integers before printing, to
	work around bug in FP print function.	
	* demo/fft_gentable.c: Update for new algorithm.

2009-03-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve use of Autotools & code cleanup.
	
	* m4/m4.m4: Add.
	* configure.ac: Check for more programs. In particular, the MT
	utilities are checked explicitly. Require GNU m4. Rename

	* bin/Makefile.am,
	* bin/cce.in,
	* bin/slc.in,	
	* bin/sgr.in: Update accordingly. Simplify. Now the scripts use
	the values supplied by Autoconf for defaults. (They can still be
	overriden via variables).

	* demo/answer.sl: Work around bug in printf (output of 64 vs. 32
	bits integers).
 	
	* demo/Makefile.am: Reinstate rules that create executables during
	"make all", so that make outputs something to try out with "sgr".

	* lib/mtalpha-sim/Makefile: Kill, as it was unused.
	
2009-03-20  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	the positive features).
	
	* demo/fibonacci.sl: Reduce N to fit execution time within 5
	seconds (timeout during tests).

	* bin/spp,
	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,
	* lib/t-pppalpha/slimpl.m4: Declare thread arguments in a single
	namespace before the create, to catch multiple definitions of the
	same identifier. Copy the thread arguments to a new temporary
	after the sync, so that further references use the temporary
	instead of the variable shared with the child family (which could

	by default.

	* include/svp/lib.slh: Fix definition of "unlikely".

	* lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,
