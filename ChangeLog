	* lib/Makefile.am: Distribute t-utc, t-utc0,

	stuff (pkgdatadir) from libraries and objects (libdir).

	* lib/host-host-seqc/slrt.c: Prevent compiler from optimizing away
	__tag__.

	the runner script.

	* lib/r-host: Fix handling of relative paths. 

	* bin/cce.in: Fix splitting of build dir and source dir (again).
