2009-09-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix support for reusing `slr' parameters in `slt'.

	A previous patch introduced a new environment variable
	EXTRA_RUN_ARGS. This approach is too intrusive as it can leak
	across test cases in a shell environment.

	* tools/bin/slt.in: Remove support for EXTRA_RUN_ARGS. Introduce a
	new option `-a' with the same effect.

2009-09-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add support for multiple source files per unit test.

	* tools/bin/slt.in: Recognize `--' as separator between test
	sources and the implementation list. For backward compatibility,
	if the separator is not present, only one source file is
	allowed. Handle multiple sources per test. (Requested by
	M. Lankamp)

2009-09-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix support for `slc -combine'.

	When using `-combine=P', multiple inclusions of `sl_support.h'
	would occur and cause multiple definitions to happen later during
	compilation.
	
	* tools/lib/t-utc0/include/sl_support.h,
	* tools/lib/t-seqc/include/sl_support.h,
	* tools/lib/t-ptl/include/sl_support.h,	
	* tools/lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Protect definitions
	with conditional.

2009-09-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add support for reusing `slr' parameters.
	
	* tools/bin/slt.in: Use the variable `EXTRA_RUN_ARGS' on each run
	of `slr'. (Requested by M. Lankamp)

2009-09-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Expose the availability of place management to programs.

	* lib/include/svp/sep.h: Introduce the macro `SVP_HAS_SEP' is
	introduced which signals to program the availability of place
	management.

2009-09-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Integrate the place allocator in the library.

	* tools/lib/mtalpha-sim/slrt.s: Move the definition of the
	pointers to fibre and variable data, as well as their
	initializations, to C code in...
	
	* slc/lib/src/mtinit.c: here. Call the place allocator
	initialization as part of the library initialization.
	
	* slc/lib/Makefile.am: Mention the new files.

	* slc/lib/mtalpha.mk: Compile them into the library.

2009-09-24  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Import Joe's work on place allocation.

	An initial version of a SVP place allocator was developed by Joe
	Master using a first-fit algorithm; this was extended to provide
	multiple allocation policies.
	
	* lib/include/svp/sep.h,
	* lib/src/mtsep.c: New.

2009-09-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix symbolic place names in `seqc'.

	The `seqc' implementation was out-of-sync with the others in not
	defining `PLACE_LOCAL' and `PLACE_DEFAULT'.
	
	* tools/lib/t-seqc/include/sl_support.h: Rename `SVP_LOCAL' to
	`PLACE_LOCAL' and define `PLACE_DEFAULT'.

2009-09-24  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Small optimization in MT-alpha code generation.
	
	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.makerepl): Prepend the dollar signs
	early.

2009-09-23  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix bugs in MT-alpha code generation.
	
	* tools/lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h: Fix `sl_setp' for
	floating-point shared parameters.

	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.findusedcallregs, pppalpha.rewritejsr):
	Be (more) careful about function calls where both int and fp
	registers are used for function calls.

	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.fixemptyf, pppalpha.filter2): Add new
	pass to rename `setempty' to `setemptyf' is the argument is a
	floating-point register. Use it.

	* tools/lib/t-utc0/slimpl.m4: Attempt to implement empty shared
	thread arguments by emitting an explicit load from the top of the
	address space.
	
2009-09-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Simplify build.
	
	* lib/ptl.mk,	
	* lib/seqc.mk: Simplify by providing a generic rule %.c -> %.o.

2009-09-21  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add support for a graphical framebuffer.

	This changeset adds support for the graphics output in the MG
	simulator introduced in r2814-r2817, and simulates a framebuffer
	using memory but no graphics when using the other SVP
	implementations.
	
	* lib/include/svp/gfx.h,
	* lib/src/gfx.c: New.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	
	* lib/seqc.mk,
	* lib/ptl.mk: Include `gfx.c' in the library.

2009-09-08  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor packaging fix.
	
	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Make script generation dependent on the
	`Makefile' itself, since they need to be re-made when tools are
	reconfigured.

2009-09-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix bug in `slr'.

	The `raw:' input scheme would attempt to load twice too many bytes
	from the file, due to an invalid loop increment.

	* tools/bin/sag: Fix bug.
	
2009-08-31  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor packaging fix.
	
	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Use unique temporary directory to build
	the scripts. This allows proper behavior when building the man
	pages in concurrent `make' invocations.

2009-08-31  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve autonomy of other packages using SLC.
	
	* build-aux/slc.m4: Also try find `slc' in PATH if not specified
	with `--with-slc' or SLC_BASE. Reject double slashes in SLC_BASE
	as this is known to cause issues with M4.

2009-08-31  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix `slr' bug.

	Under some circumstances `slr' would not be able to find which
	runner to use with an executable after it was compiled. This
	changeset addresses this issue. (reported by M. Lankamp)
	
	* tools/lib/host-host-seqc/slrt.c,	
	* tools/lib/host-host-ptl/slrt.c: Ensure that the magic strings
	are prefixed by a NUL byte so that the `strings' command can find
	them. 
	
2009-08-31  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix packaging.

	* lib/Makefile.am: Distribute and install `svp/callgate.h'.

2009-08-30  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Update documentation.

	* doc/HACKING.txt,
	* doc/NEWS.txt,
	* doc/README.txt,
	* doc/acronyms.txt,	
	* doc/requirements.txt: Update to latest software changes.

2009-08-29  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix typo in `sac_helpers.h'.

	* lib/include/sac_helpers.h (fast_safe_free): Delegate to
	`fast_free', not `safe_free'.

2009-08-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Add more SAC to muTC helpers.
	
	* lib/include/sac_helpers.h: Also provide `fast_safe_free'.

2009-08-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Packaging fix.
	
	* lib/Makefile.am: Distribute and install `calloca.h'.

2009-08-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Improve global memory allocation.

	This changeset introduces a set of `fast_' wrappers around memory
	allocation functions toavoid an intermediary function context to
	reach their respective algorithm. This was suggested by Chris
	Jesshope. Also increase the `malloc' pool by larger chunks, so
	that pool extension happens less often.
	
	* lib/src/callgate.h: Rename to...
	* lib/include/svp/callgate.h: ...here. Simplify.

	* lib/include/cmalloc.h: Provide wrappers.
	
	* lib/src/malloc_wrappers.c: Simplify by using the wrappers.
	
	* lib/mtalpha.mk,	
	* lib/src/malloc_intrinsics.c: Make the page size bigger, so that
	`malloc' increases its pool by bigger chunks.

2009-08-28  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Complete support for C's (non-standard) `alloca'.

	Since `alloca' is merely play on the stack pointer and the frame
	pointer everything was in place except the declaration of the name
	`alloca' itself. This changeset provides a header for this
	purpose.
	
	* lib/include/calloca.h: New.
	
	* lib/include/sac_helpers.h: Add `safe_free()', which calls
	`free()' if and only if it detects its argument is not the result
	of `alloca'. This is non-portable (Microgrid only).

2009-08-27  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	MT-Alpha ISA change: `allocate' takes the place identifier as input.

	Creates using the default place must flush the register passed to
	`allocate'. `setplace' disappears.

	* tools/lib/t-pppalpha/include/sl_support.h,
	* tools/lib/mtalpha-sim/main.c,
	* lib/src/callgate.h,
	* lib/src/mtalpha/mtdiv.s,
	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.create, pppalpha.remdefaults,
	pppalpha.rewritejsr): Pass the place identifier as input to
	`allocate'. Do not use `setplace' any more.

	* tools/bin/spp (pppalpha.addswchll): Recognize that `allocate'
	reads its parameter. Also recognize that `clr' and `fclr' make the
	target register immediately available for reading.
	
2009-08-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Fix packaging. This allows `make distcheck' to succeed.

	* build-aux/Makefile.am: Distribute `sl-init-autoconf'.

	* tools/bin/Makefile.am: Fix manpage dependencies to please
	`distcleancheck'.

2009-08-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Minor packaging fixes.
	
	* build-aux/slc.m4: Fail if the SL tools cannot be found. Use
	`sl-core' instead of `slc' to fetch installed files from.

2009-08-26  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Make package more reusable for other trees.

	There are two ways the parts of the source tree can be used:
	either together as sub-trees of the "base" package, or
	independently of the base package after the `sl-core' package was
	installed somewhere on the system.

	In the former case the tools and makefile rules can be picked up
	relative to the directory where they are reused; in the latter
	case they must pick them up from some agreed-upon install
	location.

	The new `sl-init-autoconf' script implements this protocol by
	fetching the aclocal and Makefile rules (.mk) from the "nearest"
	location, either a source tree "nearby" (next to the
	`sl-init-autoconf' script itself) or from the install locations.

	* build-aux/sl-init-autoconf: New.
	
	* build-aux/Makefile.am: Install `sl-init-autoconf'. Also install
	the `.mk' files to some location where `sl-init-autoconf' can find
	them.

	* Makefile.am: Recurse into `build-aux'.
	
2009-08-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Rename the package to `sl-core'.

	* configure.ac: Change package name.

2009-08-25  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	* ChangeLog: initialize.

See `ChangeLog.1' for earlier changes.
