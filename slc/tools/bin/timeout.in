Execute a program and force terminate its execution if it does not
terminate normally before a timeout.

The program is terminated with SIGTERM (exit code 143) if the timeout
expires before the command terminates. If the command does not respond
to SIGTERM, it is sent SIGKILL (exit code 137) after 2 seconds.

The default timeout is 60 seconds, unless overloaded with the
environment variable TIMEOUT.
