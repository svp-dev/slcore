 SLC Hacking  guide
====================

:Abstract: This document presents tips & tricks for developers working
   on the SLC source code.

.. contents::

Getting started
===============

1. Obtain the top-level source tree (``sys``) from a public Git branch
   or the CSA Subversion repository.

1. Read ``slc/doc/README.txt`` and ``slc/doc/HACKING.txt`` thoroughly.

2. Ensure you did #1, really. 

3. Check all the requirements are available, install/upgrade as
   needed. Use the Makefile in ``deploy`` if possible.

4. Run::

     ./boostrap
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ../configure 
     make
     make check

5. Enjoy!

Special requirements
--------------------

When working from SVN, the following *additional* requirements apply:

- Autoconf 2.63 or later

- Automake 1.11 or later

- Docutils 0.5 or later

- GNU Texinfo 4.13 or later


Working from the source directory
=================================

The ``slc`` and ``slr`` scripts are generated during
``make``. However, they contain absolute paths relative to their
installation directory. This means they cannot be used "as-is" before
``make install`` is run.

This may be a hassle during development (would require to re-run
``make install`` after each change). To balance this, it is possible
to set environment variables to indicate that the scripts should find
the data in the source directory. Use ``make show-vars`` at the
top-level source directory to set environment variables::

   $ eval `make show-vars`

Note: this will update ``PATH`` as well. Once the variables are set,
the command-line utilities can be used directly even before ``make
install`` has been run, e.g.::

   $ cd programs/demo && slc 10threads.c && slr a.out


Committing work
===============

When committing to the ``trunk`` branch of the repository:

1. ensure that ``make distcheck`` succeeds.

2. update the appropriate ``ChangeLog`` with a detailed description of
   your changes. (use ``C-x 4 a`` in Emacs from an edited file to get
   the entry automatically generated)

   .. note:: There are 4 change logs, pick the one recursively nearest
      to each change to document them. Strip the beginning of the path
      to each modified file relative to the location of the
      ChangeLog. (see previous ChangeLog entries and follow the
      pattern).

3. save the output of ``svn diff`` to a file.

4. commit your set(s) of changes, one per software package, ensuring
   that the latest ``ChangeLog`` entry for each commit is pasted into
   the commit message.

5. send the contents of the file from step #3 to the mailing list,
   ensuring that the changes to the change log(s) appear first in the
   e-mail.


Distributing
============

To package a copy of the entire SL toolchain for use by users who do
not have access to the SVN repository, perform the following steps:

1. ensure that the documentation is consistent with the state of the
   software;

2. ensure that ``slc/doc/NEWS.txt`` contains the latest major changes;

3. ensure that ``make distcheck`` succeeds.

4. commit any outstanding changes. 

5. run ``make dist``.

After step #5 has completed, ``make dist`` will have output two
archives (``.tar.gz`` and ``.tar.bz2``) suitable for distribution.

Goodies
=======

The following "features" of the source tree are there for the benefit
of the developer, not the end user of the SL toolchain:


- ``make check-slt`` at the top directory invokes ``slt`` on the
  console, and lets it use ASCII art for test results. 

  This is nicer to the eye than ``make check``, but ``make check -jN``
  can deliver test results much faster on many-core machines. In both
  cases, failed tests cause log files to stay around for further
  investigation. Fish for the log files in the test subdirectories
  (extension ``.log``), or look at what ``slt`` says about remaining
  files;

- the list of SL implementations that are tested by ``make check`` and
  ``make check-slt`` is normally derived from ``configure`` flags
  (e.g. ``--enable-check-utc``), but can be overriden with the
  environment variable ``SLT_IMPL_LIST``;

- the environment variable ``TRACE``, when set and not empty, cause
  the scripts ``slt``, ``slc``, ``slr`` and ``timeout`` to enable the
  shell tracing mode (``set -x``). 

  .. note:: This feature is redundant with the better-looking output
     of ``slc -v``, ``slr -t`` and ``slt`` 's detailed logs. Check the
     documentation of these utilities for details. However, ``TRACE``
     was introduced when debugging process management and signal
     handling in ``slt`` and may still be useful to debug the script
     internals.
