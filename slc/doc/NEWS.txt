 Release notes for SLC
=======================

This document describes major updates to SLC, the generic SVP_
compiler.

.. _SVP: http://www.svp-home.org/

SLC 2.1.0a, 2009
================

- Development version only.

- Now using the C preprocessor before M4: the ``.sl`` and ``.slh``
  extensions disappear in favor of ``.c`` and ``.h``; ``#include`` and
  ``#define`` can now be used freely and can contain SL macros.

- As a result of using the C preprocessor first, C comments inside SL
  macros do not cause strange behavior any more.

- C function definitions and calls are supported on the MT-Alpha.

- The C divide operator is reinstated.

- The C math library is supported.

- The ``slr``, ``slt`` and ``timeout`` scripts now react better to
  signals and terminal hangups.

- A new ``make`` target, ``make check-slt`` is provided to run the
  testsuite with ASCII-art output (eye-candy). ``make check`` is
  modified to use the new "parallel tests" feature from Automake 1.11
  which supports concurrency more efficiently than ``slt``.

- A new utility ``slt-many`` is provided to run ``slt`` on a custom
  list of test files / directories provided on the command line and
  provide a test results summary.

Known limitations:

- C's ``long double`` type is not supported.

- the C ``tgamma`` function may be incorrectly implemented.

- it is not (yet) possible to create a family of threads from a
  regular C function.

SLC 2.0.3a, 2009
================

- Development version only.

- Fix code generation bug for MT-Alpha happening when a thread
  function has many local variables.

- New SL language feature: ``sl_end_thread``, which causes the current
  thread to terminate.

- New data input mechanism, to allow programs to read data formatted
  in Sisal's Fibre I/O format.

- More benchmarks bundled with toolchain.

- New interface to access the thread local storage on the Microgrid,
  requires simulator revision r2462 or later.

Known issues:

- comments inside the parameters to ``sl_def`` and other SL macros
  cause undesired effects.

- only "simple" function return types are supported in function calls
  from thread functions. Also only 6 function arguments are supported,
  of "simple" types as well. See CSA note [sl1] for details.

SLC 2.0.2a, 2009
================

- Development version only.

- New function call syntax from thread functions (sl_funcall)
  documented in CSA note [sl1].

- Add memory management services to the library (malloc), based on
  Doug Lea's implementation (dlmalloc).

Known issues:

- comments inside the parameters to ``sl_def`` and other SL macros
  cause undesired effects.

- only "simple" function return types are supported in function calls
  from thread functions. Also only 6 function arguments are supported,
  of "simple" types as well. See CSA note [sl1] for details.

SL 2.0.1a, 2009
===============

- Development version only.

- Lots of bug fixes; more unit tests. 

- Change license to GPLv3 since m4_sugar is being extended.

- Support gcc 4.4 in alternate compiler for MT-Alpha.

Known issues:

- comments inside the parameters to ``sl_def`` and other SL macros
  cause undesired effects.

SLC 2.x, 2009
=============

- Development version only.

- Better documentation, including a formal SL language specification
  derived from C99.

- Alternate SL to MT-Alpha compiler.

- Initial "standard SL library".

- "utcc" renamed to "slc", to reflect the additional generality.

- New program input mechanism via "slr" helper script.

Known issues:

- comments inside the parameters to ``sl_def`` and other SL macros
  cause undesired effects.

SLC 1.x (utcc), December 2008
=============================

- Development version only.

- Include a unit test suite and demo applications together with the
  compiler.
